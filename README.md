# One Day BlackJack

A simple and fun Blackjack game I built in a few hours.


## How to play:

Just download [web_game.html](https://github.com/rhambrick/blackjack/blob/main/web_game.html) and run it in any web browser.

I also programmed the logic in C, so if you would like to compile the code yourself and run the game in the terminal, you can.

Assuming UNIX based operating system with GCC installed:

```bash
  cd folder\path\of\downloaded\program.c
  gcc program.c -o blackjack
  ./blackjack
```

Or for macOS with clang installed:
```bash
  cd folder\path\of\downloaded\program.c
  clang program.c -o blackjack
  ./blackjack
```
